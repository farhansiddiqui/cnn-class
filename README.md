# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Class supporting files

Sample code and datasets to demonstrate Convolutional Neural Network concepts and practices.

To run on Google Colab:
* Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
* File -> Open Notebook -> Github and search for https://github.com/farhansiddiqui/cnn-class
* Select a file e.g. "flower-v-auto-custom.ipynb"
* Edit -> Notebook settings -> Hardware accelerator GPU
* Uncomment second cell and run once to download datasets to Google Colab instance (!git clone https://github.com/farhansiddiqui/cnn-class.git)
* Recomment previous cell to avoid cloning repo at every run (#!git clone https://github.com/farhansiddiqui/cnn-class.git)
* Third cell, comment line -> #base_path = "." 
* Third cell, uncomment line -> base_path = "/content"
* Runtime -> Run all
